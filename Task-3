  Q-1 Ans
   The 'For' Loop
   The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use.
   It is very user friendly kind of loop that runs with a method opf using a counter.
   
    The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called 'initalizing a 'loop'.
    next ,the terminal or final value is specified.
    The for loop makes things reaily easy when you need to run a set of code multiple times.
    
    [1].Using an array.
    The following piece of code is a prefect example of how to use for loop through an array.
    var numbers[15,25,35,45,55]
    for(i=0;i<number.length;i++){
    console.log(numbers[i])
    }
    [2].Making a loop through DOM elements 
    The For Loop can also be used to alter colors.
    Consider a situation where you want to choose a particular color for all the anchors of tour page.
    In order to do so, use the following piece of code.
    var elements=document.querySelectorAll("a");
    for(var a=0;a<elements.length;i++){
    elements[i[.style.color="red";
    }
    
    The 'ForIn'Loop:-
     Another way of looping is the For In Loo.
     Unlike the For Loop, this loop won't be using a conter.
     so this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free.
     In fact,the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.
     The foolowing are the different ways of looping using the For In technique:-
     1.Looping through a Object ptoperty 
     Here's ias an example ;you've got an object containing somne properties and you need to look up each 
     property and the value that it carries.
     
     Here's how you would use the For In Loop to do so:
     
     var person={
     fname:"Adelia";
     lname:"Priya";
     age:21
     };
     for(let y in person){
     console.log(y+":"+person[y])
     }
     
     Looping Using JSON:-
     JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
     It's a light fromat for storing and transferring data from one place to another.
     so in looping, it is one of the most commonly used techniques for transporting data that is the array
     format or in attribute values.
     
     Here's an example that demonstrates the above concept.
     jsonData={
     one[10,20,30,40,50],
     two:[11,21,31],
     three:[41,51]
     }
     
     javascript object notation also consits of a root,namely,the jsonData.It further contains three nodes
     that are called ,"one","two" and "three".
     
     Here's how you can withdraw a piece of information from JSON:
     
     var json={
     one[10,20,30,40,50],
     two:[11,21,31],
     three:[41,51]
     }
     };
     for(var key in json.jsonData){
     for(var key1 in json.jsonData[key]){
     console.log(json.jsonData[key][key1])
     }
     }
     Above i have used two For In Loop to make use of JSON and extract information from it.
     One of those loops is the outer lopop that runs three times.
     if you're wondering why it needs to run three times,
     that's because it has to cover the above-mentioned nodes.
     [3].The ForEach()Loop
     This method is used for looping through an array element.
     here i took a example of this:
     
     var names=["adelia","priya","karthi","ashok","varshini"];
     names.forEach(function1);
     function function1(currentValue,index){
     console.log("index in arrayis:"+index+"::Value is :"+currentValue);
     }
     [4].for...of():-
     The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects,including:built-in String,Array,array-like objects
     (e.g.,arguments or NodeList),TypedArray,Map,Set,and user-defined iterables.
     It invokes a custom iteration hook with statement to be excuted for the value of each distinct 
     property of the object.
     
     Simple Code:-
     
     const array1=["a","s","h","o","k"];
     
     for(const element of array1){
     console.log(element);
     }

            Q-3 Answer:-
            The main difference is given below between these three
            Image result for read about the difference between window screen and document in javascript
            window is the root of everything,screen just has screen dimensions,and document is top DOM object
